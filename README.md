# my_first_app

I've built a WhatsApp-like app using Flutter. It's all about creating a user-friendly chat experience. I've designed the app's look and feel, added chat lists, and made sure contacts have circular profile pictures for a nice touch. It's a fun project that showcases my design and app-building skills.
